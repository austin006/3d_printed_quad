## Revisions for later

* AI Agents on a companion computer
* Wireless comms
* Check on what WiFi antenna we have
* Talk directly quad-to-quad?
* Find a camera to add to frame
* Make sure frame can fit microcomputer with GPU (e.g. [Orin Nano](https://marketplace.nvidia.com/en-us/enterprise/robotics-edge/?limit=15) or similar)

## Completed

* Change frame to accommodate [Pixracer Pro](https://store.3dr.com/pixracer-pro/)
