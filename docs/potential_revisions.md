# Potential Revisions

## In progress

* Wireless comms
* Check on what WiFi antenna we have
* Talk directly quad-to-quad?
* Find a camera to add to frame
* Make sure frame can fit microcomputer with GPU (e.g. [Orin Nano](https://marketplace.nvidia.com/en-us/enterprise/robotics-edge/?limit=15) or similar)

## Revisions for later

* Add prop guards
* Add spherical guard so it can crash into stuff, make self-righting so it always points up after it lands


## Completed

* Possibly change frame to accommodate [Pixracer Pro](https://store.3dr.com/pixracer-pro/)
